Programs I did in my Masters or PhD in Physics.

3_body_problem : A numerical code for solving the 3 body problem with gravitational, elastic and electric forces among the 3 bodies.

Lab_plot&fit_program: Work done in Laboratory classes. Contains a program that performs plots, histograms or fits of the experimental data. The development of this program was essential since we needed a high degree of personalisation in our plots. My group had the best grade in the class.

python_ObjectOriented_exam: When I was learning python a friend of mine gave me some class material. This was my atempt at solving this exam on python object-oriented programming.

fluid_sim: Tentative numerical simulation of the behaviour of a fluid after an explosion (a spike in pressure & energy). 

neutrino/vlq_parameter_space: Code I developed in my PhD. It contains a generator of the complete parameter space of the Standard Model + 3 right-handed neutrinos or 1 up vector-like quark (vlq). It is then possible to restrict the parameter space using experimental bounds/data. 
In the vlq case, it contains a machine learning minimization algorithm that finds the region of the parameter space that best fits the experimental data.
