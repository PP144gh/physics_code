This was for a class where the intention was for the student to develop one idea and then write a paper on it. I used C++ to develop a simulation of population growth and evolution based on the idea of Reinforcement Learning. The model correctly predicts the development of a population around food sources and their migration in search of a new one when the known ones become saturated. Additionally, I compared the model to a pure random one and the population number was fitted to a logistic function for an interesting evolution of the system. Detais can be read in the paper file "II_78889.pdf". Source code can be found in work/codes/main_code/life.C .
